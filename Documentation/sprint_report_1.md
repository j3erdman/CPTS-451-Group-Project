## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 1, our team finished intializing and setting up our project's environment. This included the database, backend, and frontend. The goal of this was to allow us to focus on actual features in future sprints, instead of trying to setup a frameworks that may or may not be difficult to incorporate into the rest of the project's code. Sprint 1 could've been larger, since initializing each part of the project isn't difficult, but we wanted to make sure that there weren't an issues with the initializing before implementing actual features for the project.
