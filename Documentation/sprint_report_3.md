## Work Summary 
During Sprint 3, we were able to finish all of the remaining issues for the project and updated the website's CSS to make it look nicer. The remaining issues included the remaining admin issues from sprint 2, and then the full implementation of supplier's functionality. This sprint went pretty smoothly because there weren't too many issues left.
