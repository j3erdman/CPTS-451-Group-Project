## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Provide a one paragraph synposis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any significant learnings for your team.

During Sprint 2, we were able to finish all the issues related to the user view, including account-related issues and user action related issues. As a group, we did have some trouble implementating these issues due to some of our members' lack of experience with react.js or flask. So we had to struggle and learn how to implemenent our features with react.js + flask. So this sprint was a big learning experience and a large number of features were implemented during this sprint.
